### Commit style guide

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.

Please prefix your commit messages with one of the following:

  * `fix`: A bug fix.
  * `feat`: A new feature.
  * `docs`: Documentation only changes.
  * `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
  * `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature.
  * `test`: Adding missing tests.
  * `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.
